# Description

This is the UI for an intermediately complex, multipage website theme. An example use case for these files is for the admin/management of a custom web app.

# Stack

HTML from scratch, Bootstrap4 for styling and icons from Font Awesome. There is a little bit of custom Javascript in addition to the JQuery used by Bootstrap4.

Bootstrap4 was downloaded and re-compiled with custom CSS using Koala. In other words, Bootstrap is not accessed using a CDN. Using this approach allowed for easier re-styling of the default color-scheme in Bootstrap4.

# Detail

The markup used in these pages showcases:

- The grid
- Responsiveness and mobile-first design
- Many components of the Bootstrap4 framework such as cards, accordions, modals, media queries, and form formatting
- Custom CSS, and the use of a pre-processor like Koala
- Icons from Font Awesome
- How a little bit of custom Javascript can be integrated into a UI to make things like a slider

# Reference

I created this page as part of a Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/learn/v4/overview) with Brad Travery. I recommend the course for anyone curious about how to be more effective using a CSS framework like Bootstrap, or the role Sass plays in CSS-related workflows.
