# Description

This is the UI for a simple, one page website.

# Stack

HTML from scratch, Bootstrap4 for styling and icons from Font Awesome. There is a tiny bit of Javascript to animate some of the transitions from one id to another.

Bootstrap4 is accessed through a CDN. It also uses JQuery, so JQuery is a dependency of this page.

# Detail

The markup used in this page showcases the use of the grid, responsiveness, mobile-first design.

# Reference

I created this page as part of a Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/learn/v4/overview) with Brad Travery.
